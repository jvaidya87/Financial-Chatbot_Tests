# Financial-Chatbot_Tests
Test a range of methods for developing a rudimentary financial chatbot based on tf-idf, word-2-vec, doc-2-vec, pre-trained Glove embeddings and transformer architectures (as represented by a pre-trained BERT model)

## Why was this project undertaken?
The goal of this project is to compare and contrast a handful of approaches to generating a financial chatbot capable of helping educate users on a range of topics encompassed by the term "personal finance"

## What is needed to run this notebook?
The current version of this notebook uses the following packages/versions

torch == 1.8.1
tensorflow == 2.8.0
spacy == 3.0.6
nltk == 3.6.2
gensim == 4.0.1

Users will also need to download a copy of the pre-trained [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/); the 6B.zip is used for this project

## Who could benefit from this notebook?
This project is intended to showcase several approaches for the quick development of rudimentary chatbots, which could be further refined for practical applications in various settings
